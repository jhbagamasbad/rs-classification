    "Before we proceed, since there are now two columns for the most played playing positions of players, we need to manually modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example is the Luka Dončić trade of 2024-2025. During his [time in Dallas for that season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DAL/2025.html#all_pbp_stats) (Look at the play-by-play section if link does not directly load there) he played 73% of the time he was on the court as a Point Guard, and 27% as Shooting Guard, while [as a Laker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2025.html#all_pbp_stats) he played 45% as a Point Guard, 43% as a Shooting Guard and 12% as a Small Forward. For simplicity in determining their two most dominant playing positions, at they must have played at least 60% of the total percentage allowed for each position. So as a Maverick, given that he played two positions (PG and SG), the allowed percentage for each position is an even 50%. So 60% of 50% should be 30% in order for a position to qualify as dominant playing position for him. Since he played only 27% as a Shooting Guard, for his time in Dallas in 2024-2025 he can qualify as only playing the Point Guard position in both columns for positions (Pos1 and Pos2).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Laker, we can change his entry there as Pos1 = PG, and Pos2 = SG, given that he played 43% or more for both positions. Had he played 20% as a Small Forward and the remaining two positions also had 20% or more, We would list his Pos1 as Point Guard (given that it would be his most dominant position), and his Pos2 = SF. Although he qualified as SG as well, we go in sequence of playing positions (PG -> SG -> SF -> PF -> C or PG <- SG <- SF <- PF <- C) when a player is dominant in multiple positions. This will be further clarified when computing for the per season rank score of players.\n",
